# 🌱 Aasha.Hope — Trust-Based Crowdfunding & Social Donation Platform

Aasha.Hope is a full-stack crowdfunding platform that enables NGOs and individuals to raise funds transparently, while helping donors stay emotionally connected to the causes they support.

Unlike traditional donation platforms that end at a payment confirmation, Aasha.Hope introduces a social transparency layer that allows donors to follow NGOs, view regular updates, and see real-world impact after donating — encouraging trust, community, and long-term donor retention.
